This repo is for the week 1 homework. 
  I changed some of the <div> tags and classes that were within the HTML file to semantic elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <article>,    <section>, and <aside>. 
    I also updated the css file to properly reference the HTML file.
  I fixed the broken SEO link to properly navigate to the correct part of the webpage. 
  Lastly, I checked for accessibility issues through Siteimprove Accessibility Checker
